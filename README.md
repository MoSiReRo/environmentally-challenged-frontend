Environmentally-Challenged Application - Frontend

This is the frontend of a basic Application, titled Environmentally Challenged. 

Each day, the App offers Users a challenge, inviting them to make a change to their daily habits, for example 'Limit your shower to 2 minutes' or 'Switch your utility bills to paperless'. Their completed challenges render as a progress-circle-bar. When a User completes 21 challenges, the App's sponsor plants a tree on their behalf. 

Made by Rebecca French, Rosie Inman, Simone Klein and Monika Urbankska, it was built during the Women in Tech course, run by Tech Returners and the BBC. It integrates with a backend, available [here]

The hosted version of the application is available here: https://github.com/MoSiReRo/environmentally-challenged-frontend
